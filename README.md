# flightSystemFile
HELLO WELCOME This flight reservation system consists of admin and passenger-user sections, the admin account is pre-registered by default; the normal user must register first to access this system. The admin can add, update or delete a flight. And the user can search, reserve or cancel a flight. The user's search system is such that each line is asked to user to enter information related to the flight, including flight ID, origin, destination, date, time and price range (I emphasize only the price range). User can enter any one he/she want and leave any one blank.and all the tickets with the entered feature will be printed and the user will receive a ticket ID after booking the ticket which can be used to cancel the flight and there is also an option to <> which the user Access it by entering the ticket ID. This program never stops and even if an exception or error occurs, it transfers the user to the first page without erasing the previous memories.and by random accessFilefile
